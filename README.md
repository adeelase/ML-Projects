# ML-Projects
This repository contains Machine Learning Projects that I created for completion of the Machine Learning Coursework During my 1st semester of Masters in CSE at IIT. It consists of two parts ,one part is on a Classification Problem while the Second one is on Regression.

#Classification Problem

The classification problem is centered around credit card information, attainable from the following link: 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/27/credit+approval'. After procuring the dataset and converting it into a .csv format, I undertook a series of data preprocessing steps, encompassing data cleaning (eliminating unwanted values and null entries), the application of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to curtail data dimensionality, and outlier detection, among others. Subsequently, a spectrum of machine learning techniques including Random Forest Classifier, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree Classifiers, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines were employed to formulate a predictive ML model for one attribute based on others. The resultant outcomes were rigorously evaluated using a gamut of classification performance metrics, spanning Confusion Matrix, accuracy score, precision, recall, F1 score, and more.

#Regression Problem

The regression problem is centered on automobile-related data, retrievable from the following link: 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/10/automobile'. Following the acquisition and conversion of the data into a .csv format, a series of data preprocessing steps were undertaken. These encompassed data cleaning, involving the removal of unwanted and null values, the elimination of highly correlated columns, the application of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to streamline data dimensionality, and the identification of outliers. Subsequently, a variety of machine learning techniques, including Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression, KNN regressor, regression trees, Neural networks, and Support Vector Regressor, were employed to fashion an ML model for predicting automobile prices based on other attributes. The veracity of the outcomes was gauged using an array of regression performance metrics, including Mean Squared Error, R Square score, and Accuracy.
